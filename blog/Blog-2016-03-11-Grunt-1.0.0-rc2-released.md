The Grunt team is pleased to announce the **second release candidate** for `1.0.0`.

This release is made possible by [@shama](https://github.com/shama), [@vladikoff](https://github.com/vladikoff), [@jkaussieskater](https://github.com/jkaussieskater), [@dmethvin](https://github.com/dmethvin).

Also thanks to contributions by [@XhmikosR](https://github.com/XhmikosR), [@notclive](https://github.com/notclive), [@arithmetric](https://github.com/arithmetric) and more.

We ask you to test the `rc2` and [report any issues](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues) you are experiencing.

> npm install grunt@1.0.0-rc2 --save-dev

**[Please read the RC1 blog post](http://gruntjs.com/blog/2016-02-11-grunt-1.0.0-rc1-released) for more details about changes to Grunt with version 1.0.**

## Peer Dependencies
If you have a Grunt plugin that includes `grunt` in the `peerDependencies` section of your `package.json`, we recommend tagging with `"grunt": ">=0.4.0"`.
Otherwise when `grunt@1.0.0` is released, npm@2 users will receive a hard error when trying to install your plugin and npm@3 users will get a warning.
We have sent over two thousand pull requests to existing plugins to make this change.

**We ask you to send pull requests to your favourite plugins and ask them to update the `peerDependencies` section of their `package.json`.**

## Changes in RC2

- Prevent async callback from being called multiple times. Pull #1464.
- Update copyright to jQuery Foundation and remove redundant headers. Fixes #1478.
- Update glob to 7.0.x. Fixes #1467.
- Removing duplicate BOM strip code. Pull #1482.

As we mentioned before, we are also looking for contributors to all [Grunt repositories](https://github.com/gruntjs/) and are willing to mentor you to get more experience with open source.

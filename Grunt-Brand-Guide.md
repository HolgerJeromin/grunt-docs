We have a few guidelines for using Grunt’s brand resources—please take a moment to familiarize yourself with them.

## Logomark

The Grunt Logomark is a badass warthog. We use it as a standalone graphic and in combination with the Wordmark Grunt.

<div class="logomark">

![Grunt warthog logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isaacdurazo/gruntjs.com/44-brand-guide/src/img/brand-guide/grunt-no-wordmark.jpg)
</div>

## Wordmark

Grunt's Wordmark is "Grunt". When used in a sentence, the Wordmark should always appear with a capitalized "G", lowercase "runt". 

The Wordmark must be written in all uppercase ("GRUNT") when being treated graphically, such as when the brand name appears with the Grunt Logo Mark.

## Safety space

When using the Grunt Logo with other logos and graphic elements, maintain a safety space that equals 150% the size of the square around it.

<div class="safety">
![From the logo's dimensions, there should be 25% padding surrounding the Grunt logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isaacdurazo/gruntjs.com/44-brand-guide/src/img/brand-guide/safety-space.jpg)
</div>

## Typography

We use a slightly modified version of Lato in our Logo, yes it’s is open source and we can do that, deal with it. 

Lato was created by [Łukasz Dziedzic](https://plus.google.com/106163021290874968147/about)

For the content in our website we use the original version of Lato. Google hosts a copy of this font. You can download here:

## Usage

Grunt is an Open Source Project, but that doesn’t mean you can do whatever the heck you want with our logo. Please follow our guidelines or we will come after you. Thanks.

## Promotion

Every Open Source Project benefits from the promotion their users make, and Grunt is not an exception. Want to share the project with the world? are you using Grunt in your project and want to brag about it? Here are a few options for you:

## Twitter

The word “Grunt” might be too generic for Twitter, so use the hashtag #GruntJS instead to share your love

## [Badges](/built-with-grunt-badge)

Do you use Grunt in a project and want to proudly display that in your project README or on your project website? Now you can with the "Built with Grunt" badge!

[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.svg)](http://gruntjs.com/)

## Using the Badge

Just copy the following Markdown code snippet and paste it right underneath the headline in your project README. You can also put it on your project website homepage or footer.

```
[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.svg)](http://gruntjs.com/)
```

If you need an HTML version, we've got you covered.

```html
<a href="http://gruntjs.com/"><img src="https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.svg" alt="Built with Grunt"></a>
```

## For example...

As you can see, the "Built with Grunt" badge is modern, stylish, and has been designed to fit nicely next to all your project's other mini-badges. You can put it first, last, or anywhere in the middle. Have fun!

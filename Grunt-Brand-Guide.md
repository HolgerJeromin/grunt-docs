We have a few guidelines for using Grunt’s brand resources—please take a moment to familiarize yourself with them.

## Logomark

The Grunt Logomark is a badass warthog. We use it as a standalone graphic and in combination with the Wordmark Grunt.

<div class="logomark">
![Grunt warthog logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isaacdurazo/gruntjs.com/44-brand-guide/src/img/brand-guide/grunt-no-wordmark.jpg)
![Wordmark Grunt warthog logo with "GRUNT" caption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isaacdurazo/gruntjs.com/44-brand-guide/src/img/brand-guide/grunt-wordmark.jpg)
</div>

## Wordmark

When the name "Grunt" is written stand-alone, or being treated graphically, the Grunt wordmark should be written in uppercase (i.e. GRUNT).

However, when referring to Grunt in a sentence, the Grunt wordmark should be written as a proper-noun, capitalizing only the first letter (e.g. "We use Grunt to assemble our project!").

## Safety space

When using the Grunt Logo with other logos or graphic elements, ensure a 'safety space' is surrounding the Grunt logo:
* 25% of the logo's width should be spaced to the left and right
* 25% of the logo's height should be spaced above and below

In other words, the Grunt logo and its safety space should have a size that's 150% of the the logo itself.

<div class="safety">

</div>

## Typography

When using the Grunt wordmark graphically (and in all-caps), please use the open source font "Lato".

Lato was created by [Łukasz Dziedzic](https://plus.google.com/106163021290874968147/about), and Google hosts a copy of this font. You can download here:

<a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato" class="button">Lato Font</a>

Whilst we use the original Lato font on the Grunt website, we've slightly modified the font in the wordmarked logo.

## Usage

Grunt is an Open Source Project, and whilst you're free to use our logo, we ask that you respect our guidelines. Although you might have the best intentions, we don't want you to alter the official Grunt logo. Here are some examples of logo usage that we do NOT support:

<div class="usage">
![Don't add embellishments to the Grunt logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isaacdurazo/gruntjs.com/44-brand-guide/src/img/brand-guide/dont-1.jpg)
![Don't stretch the logo, or change the x:y ratio of its dimensions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isaacdurazo/gruntjs.com/44-brand-guide/src/img/brand-guide/dont-2.jpg)
![Don't alter the "GRUNT" caption, or embed a customised caption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isaacdurazo/gruntjs.com/44-brand-guide/src/img/brand-guide/dont-3.jpg)
![Don't alter the colors of the logo, using filters or otherwise](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isaacdurazo/gruntjs.com/44-brand-guide/src/img/brand-guide/dont-4.jpg)
</div>

## Promotion

Every Open Source Project benefits from the promotion their users make, and Grunt is not an exception. Want to share the project with the world? are you using Grunt in your project and want to brag about it? Here are a few options for you:

## Twitter

The word “Grunt” might be too generic for Twitter, so use the hashtag #GruntJS instead to share your love

## [Badges](/built-with-grunt-badge)

Do you use Grunt in a project and want to proudly display that in your project README or on your project website? Now you can with the "Built with Grunt" badge!

[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.svg)](http://gruntjs.com/)

## Using the Badge

Just copy the following Markdown code snippet and paste it right underneath the headline in your project README. You can also put it on your project website homepage or footer.

```
[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.svg)](http://gruntjs.com/)
```

If you need an HTML version, we've got you covered.

```html
<a href="http://gruntjs.com/"><img src="https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.svg" alt="Built with Grunt"></a>
```

## For example...

As you can see, the "Built with Grunt" badge is modern, stylish, and has been designed to fit nicely next to all your project's other mini-badges. You can put it first, last, or anywhere in the middle. Have fun!
